It would be best if you cloned the code repository.

In this task, you have to write a correct and efficient algorithm to check large numbers as prime or not.
The test cases will measure your system time clocks and try to categorize the code efficiency level approximately.

The excellent is the best level, while bad is the worst one.
You can do a google search to see the best mathematical solution for this problem, but please do NOT search for implementation. Try to convert that mathematical answer to Java code.
